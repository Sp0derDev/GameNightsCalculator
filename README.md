# Game Nights Calculator
This is a wonderful flutter application made by Veia and I.
It will help make our lives (game nights to be specific) a bit easier by handling most (if not all) the calculations needed for our favorite card games.

**This application currently suports only one game ( Hand )**

We are currently working on other games such as 
- Tarneeb
- Trix
- Complex

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and open it in VSCode or Android Studio.
2. Run It And Enjoy!

Alternatively, you can download the IPA/APK file and install it onto your device.
